# Taking notes for productivity - Effective Programmer pt. 1

> Organizing knowledge is a key factor of effective programming work. Is taking notes the perfect way to do it? I think yes answering all of the why and how questions.

***

I'd like to welcome you to the first article from the **Effective Programmer** series. As it's the first episode I'd like to give you a brief introduction to the series:

My goal is to describe productivity tips I find useful in my everyday work. **I don't claim to be a productivity expert**, but I find some methods truly helpful and I'd like to share them with you.

The topic of being effective is so wide that there are books written about it. I will try to narrow down the scope of each article as much as possible, to focus only on the essential things from my perspective.

**Shortly about me**, to show you what I am doing and what kind of problems I face:

I am a **freelance full-stack developer working mostly with Ruby on Rails and React**. While being a freelancer I usually work for **multiple clients** who care more about the output of my work than how long it took.

The output, in other words: **value** - it's what I am focusing on. My work made me realize that everything could be optimized and while finding *the better way* to do things is sometimes difficult at the beginning, in the end, it makes everyone happier.

And I'd be simply happy if you would find anything useful here.

# Notes

Everyone was taking(or making) them in school days, except the arrogant/genius kids who trusted that they will remember everything. If you were one of the geniuses who indeed didn't have to take notes, good for you. But the rest 98% might find this topic relevant.

In school, I knew that I should note at least something - *still my notebook was usually one of the emptiest*.

But then, a few years fast forward to my first job and you know what? **I was entirely sure that I could take almost everything straight into my head. And I regret that.**

Later, I started taking notes, but it wasn't an instant change, I had to grow up, and humble down. There were more and more things to remember and I was forced to find a more convenient place for storing the information than in my head.

# Why you should consider taking notes?

## Make the knowledge easily accessible

Knowledge is always accessible **somewhere** on the internet. But googling every time you need to use the "this" special command, or link to API documentation **takes time**. If you find the information once it's way more convenient to at least store a link to this resource. Notes are ideal for it.

Did you ever spend minutes scrolling and searching for a specific message that your colleague sent you in the past? I did and sometimes even didn't find the thing I was looking for. **It'd be way easier if I'd save it.**

And yeah it's difficult to know which piece of information you will find useful in the future. Oftentimes you can't know, but the thing is to make taking notes your **habit**, sooner on later it will pay off the investment.

Imagine a car repair shop, all tools should have their own place there. It helps the mechanic as he always knows where to look for a certain thing. Otherwise, his work will quickly become frustrating as he'll spend more time searching for tools than repairing cars.

It's a bit extreme example, but I feel that in programming we use way more tools and also have to understand the abstract needs of our clients. On a bigger scale, **it's impossible to do it all efficiently without processing and saving the things we already know**.

I am a fan of keeping things simple so I encourage you to take notes, but I believe *David Thomas and Andrew Hunt* had similar thoughts while writing about [Engineering Daybooks](https://mikebabb.com/blog/engineering-daybooks/){:target="_blank"} in *[The Pragmatic Programmer book](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/){:target="_blank"}*.

## Deep understanding

> If you cannot explain something in simple terms, you don't understand it. The best way to learn is to teach. - *Prof. Feynman*

Treat taking notes as a process of explaining the thing to yourself. While writing you might find out that there are certain topics that are unclear to you.

## Be professional

Imagine your manager asking you a specific technical question about the thing you worked on a few months ago. If you would send him your notes about that topic clarifying the question it would be impressive, it's a great way to show that you are professional and you **treat your work seriously**.

It was a cool scenario, but I do see a better one:

## It could be more than a note

What if you could **share** your notes with everyone? The question won't be made in the first place or you'll just answer with a link.

I believe that **good notes could be easily translated into documentation. If you find the information essential, others would likely also benefit from it.**

Don't get me wrong, **notes are supposed to help you in the first place**, but usually, with little to no effort, they could also help others.

# How to take notes

Structuring and deciding what to put inside is a challenge on its own. Everyone could take a different approach, and for each person, different strategies might work. I'd recommend you read [the article about Note-Taking methods](https://medium.goodnotes.com/the-best-note-taking-methods-for-college-students-451f412e264e){:target="_blank"} written by GoodNotes to pick the method that suits you the most.

Methods could be different but you should always make sure they're **well formatted and without typos**(consider using Grammarly).

## How to define a good note?

First, it should be helping you.

But it's only halfway true, you shouldn't trust yourself. **Share your notes with others**. They might ask clarifying questions or tell you that they don't like something inside. The reaction of others will show you if you understand and explained the topic well.

**No matter what is the feedback you should take it**. If there is no feedback - that's also fine, you've done your part.

# How to organize the notes?

**How I organize the notes, to be clear, there are surely better ways.**

It depends on the thing I work on. I am trying to organize notes **per-topic** to have them **easily available**. For example: If I work on `project X` there are high chances I do have opened:

**1)** This project's Slack channel or
**2)** Code editor with its project repository.

Knowing that I'd start considering if I could store my notes in any of these places. Just to **remove any friction between the work and writing notes**. Talking about **sharing**, both `Slack` and `Github` are publicly available for other team members so they seem to be a good fit.

Let's go through different topics and see how I organize notes for them:

## Project Notes

The main note-taking tool for every client I work with is **Slack**. Why? **It's the place where everyone exchanges knowledge**, sometimes you just have to **distil the essential bits** from the discussion.

How exactly do I use it for taking notes?

1. **Send a message to me with any useful commands/scripts/domain knowledge:**

	Create a new message and add yourself as a recipient. It will create a private channel where you could send anything. But, I recommend you always ask the question *"Is there anyone else who could also benefit from it?"*

	If the answer is yes then...
1. **Create a public note-sharing channel**

	It's a great place to share important lessons from our work. I am not an **Agile** expert, but praising the **sharing culture** seems to align well with the manifesto for me.

	The plus of doing it on Slack is that it's having low entry barriers. It's way easier to send a short Slack message than add a new section to the documentation(what you should also do later).
1. **Add any useful message to `Saved Items`:**

   Someone shared a valuable link, piece of information, command or anything you find useful? Just save it and look into the `Saved Items` card. If you'd always save the essential messages I am sure soon you will have a good knowledge database there.
1. **Share production command execution on a shared channel:**

	It's loosely related to the note-taking topic but it worked really well in one of my previous projects so wanted to share it:

	Create a separate channel monitoring manual activities on production servers. Answer for name and purpose before starting a console session and then attach it as a context to all messages shared on Slack.

	Thanks, [Arkency](https://blog.arkency.com/keep-your-team-up-to-date-on-production-data-changes/){:target="_blank"} for sharing the idea, it was a huge win on multiple fields as:
	- every developer is instantly notified about executing special code in production, it's easy to ask for details
	- when you know that anything you execute will be seen by others you think twice before doing so
	- you have the history of all executed scripts and commands in one place, it's useful for audits but also when something has to be re-executed then you could easily find the right command on the channel.

**Slack works well for taking notes in a short-term perspective.** Over time as there are more and more things it could become messy. That's why I recommend **transforming your notes into documentation**. Either [GitHub Wiki](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis){:target="_blank"} or [Notion](https://www.notion.so/){:target="_blank"} will be superior with abilities to properly organize pieces of information across subjects.

I've been in a few projects where the documentation was written only when someone was leaving the team. It's difficult to write the documentation post-factum, the challenge is to decide what's important then.

**I encourage everyone to write notes and docs iteratively when the knowledge is fresh.**

## Technical notes

We're getting outside the project/company. You might save everything in the "Notes" application installed on every PC and it'll definitely work, but I do see a better option:

**Maybe you should consider starting a blog?** Start small, just a few phrases and a short code example. If not a blog maybe just post it on **Twitter**?

**Why?** A blog or Twitter account are **places where you could confront your thinking with others**. You'd be surprised how good it might work. I already mentioned it, but I didn't give any example:

Recently, I've published a [short article about deploying Rails applications with Capistrano](https://jmatuszewski.com/How-to-deploy-multiple-apps-on-single-server-with-Capistrano/){:target="_blank"} that gained some attention only because people were saying that my solution is crappy. But they also shared a better one, I'd never learn this better approach without sharing this post.

Thanks to the feedback this post is already rewritten with the cleaner solution and I understand Capistrano better, a **win-win** scenario.

> Collecting feedback is an awesome opportunity for learning

There is one other tool I'd like to mention: [Gist](https://gist.github.com/){:target="_blank"}. I usually save there any system commands or cURL requests. Gists are private by default, but at any moment you could publish them.

## Getting Offline

After spending so many hours in front of our displays I find it soul-healing to use pen and paper sometimes. While being completely offline(it also means leaving the phone) I do have a so rare ocassion to listen to myself.

Silence and lack of external stimuli becomes a privilege nowadays as we're consciously choosing distractions. Take a step back, write down your thoughts. I am not sure if it will help you to be more effective but definitely will help your sanity.
