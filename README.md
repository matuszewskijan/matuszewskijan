# Hey, I'm Jan Matuszewski! 👋

I'm a **full-stack developer** from Poland, specializing in **Ruby on Rails**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript**.
I’m passionate about **clean architecture**, **maintainable code**, and **performance optimization**.

When I'm not coding, you might find me diving into leadership or data systems books, **running marathons**, or **rock climbing** to recharge. I also maintain a **tech blog** on [jmatuszewski.com](https://jmatuszewski.com), where I share insights on software craftsmanship, productivity tips, and behind-the-scenes looks at interesting projects.

If you want to collaborate on an exciting project—or talk about how to make code simpler and faster—**reach out anytime**!
